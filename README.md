# Unity CRUD consuming API with Express + Sequelize + MySQL and Auth Basic + Token Bearer

It's just that: An example with Unity consuming an API with Express + Sequelize + MySQL. Auth Basic and Token Bearer is used for the Authentication.

It's just a very raw example:
* No validations at all.
* No error checks.
* Don't try to Login before Signup successfully because there is no validations.
* To see the result of "Show bicycles" go to the Console.
* Don't forget to enter a valid id to update/delete a bicycle.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need a working environment with:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) - You can install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com) - You can install itconfrom https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/es/download/. It's advisable to install the LTS version.
* [Unity](https://store.unity.com/es/download) - Install Unity Personal from https://store.unity.com/es/download.

## General Installation instructions

The best option to start with this project is cloning it in your PC:

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/UnityWebRequestExpressSequelizeBasicAuthTokenBearer.git
```

This project contains 2 different parts:
* Frontend
* Backend

### In the backend

You need a backend/db.config.js file with the data for the connection to your MySQL Server. So create a backend/.env file:

```
JWT_SECRET=V3RY#1MP0RT@NT$3CR3T#

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_NAME=db_bicycles_unity
DB_PASSWORD=YourPassword
```

You need a mysql server working.

Create the mysql database, that in our case is "db_bicycles_unity".

You need a node.js working environment. The LTS is recommended: https://nodejs.org/es/

Once you have cloned the project install all dependencies:

```
cd UnityWebRequestExpressSequelizeBasicAuthTokenBearer/backend
npm install
```

Finally start your backend.

```
cd UnityWebRequestExpressSequelizeBasicAuthTokenBearer/backend
npm start
```

### In the frontend

Just open the `frontend` project with Unity Editor and run the scene `Menu`.

Take into account that this project is just a very raw example:
* No validations at all.
* No error checks.
* Don't try to Login before Signup successfully because there is no validations.
* To see the result of "Show bicycles" go to the Console.
* Don't forget to enter a valid id to update/delete a bicycle.
